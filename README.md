- [Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) -> Kotlin Compose allows developers to create user interfaces in a fast and declarative manner, making the Android app development process more efficient.
- [Preference Data Store](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/datastore) -> Jetpack DataStore is a data storage solution that allows you to store key-value pairs or typed objects with protocol buffers. DataStore uses Kotlin coroutines and Flow to store data asynchronously, consistently, and transactionally.
- [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) -> Library support for Kotlin coroutines
- [StateFlow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow/stateflow-and-sharedflow) -> StateFlow is a state-holder observable flow that emits the current and new state updates to its collectors. The current state value can also be read through its value property. To update state and send it to the flow, assign a new value to the value property of the MutableStateFlow class.
- [Dagger Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) -> Hilt provides a standard way to incorporate Dagger dependency injection into an Android application.
- [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) -> ViewModel class is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.
- [Compose Navigation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation) -> The Navigation component provides support for Jetpack Compose applications. You can navigate between composables while taking advantage of the Navigation component’s infrastructure and features.
